#Algorithm to find the maximum positive integer input by a user.
#The User repeatedly inputs numbers until a negative value is entered.

#Can use a while loop to keep asking for an int while the number is bigger than 0
#When it's negative we stop and print the maximum  number.

#so while the number is bigger then 0 keep asking for an input.
#When you get a negative input we calculate what the largest input was.

#First I created a variable for the maximum integer. Then if the input is > than the maximum, the input takes the maximum value.
#If a bigger number is inputted then it takes the maximum value until  we hit a negative number then we print the result
